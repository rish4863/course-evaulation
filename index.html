        <h1> Explanation</h1>
<p> I am doing the graphs so students can find out what the course was like and use that to find out if they should take that class or not. To make the graphs I plan to first download the pdfs into an excel file. I use separate excel files for all of them.  Next I use the spyder code to help me make the graphs and it will show the percentage and a wide variety of grades. I put in the import pandas and the data read command. Next I do the df. read which reads the CSV file. 
  
  Next I put in the plt bar graphs syntax which creates the bar graphs and pick the blue color as the default. I also did the plt title and the plt show with the axis to finally complete the graphs. I got inspiration from my coding with NASA and from my GIS class. I use spyder for both of these projects. 

I use Spyder for NASA so I can find out how many people particpated in the challenges that NASA offered. For my GIS class I was finding out how many COVID cases and deaths there were in Australia.  
  
  Afterwards I use codepen to make the graphs appear on the website. I use html as the code format and CSS styles then exported it as a zip file and then upload  it into Github. I also made pie charts using the syntax plt.pie. There are many ways that the data can be explained by pie charts or by bar charts.
