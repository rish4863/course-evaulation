        <h1> Explanation</h1>
<p> I am doing the graphs so students can find out what the course was like and use that to find out if they should take that class or not. To make the graphs I plan to first download the pdfs into an excel file. I use separate excel files for all of them.  Next I use the spyder code to help me make the graphs and it will show the percentage and a wide variety of grades. I put in the import pandas and the data read command. Next I do the df. read which reads the CSV file. Next I put in the plt bar graphs syntax which creates the bar graphs and pick the blue color as the default. I also did the plt title and the plt show with the axis to finally complete the graphs.  </p>
